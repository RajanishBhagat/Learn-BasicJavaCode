//Java for loop program
class ForLoop {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int c;
   
    for (c = 1; c <= 10; c++) {
      System.out.println(c);
    }
  }
}


Infinite loop using while 
class B
{
public static void main (String args [])
{
while(true)
{
System.out.println("Rajanish Bhagat");
}
}
}

Output :  Rajanish Bhagat will print infinit time
